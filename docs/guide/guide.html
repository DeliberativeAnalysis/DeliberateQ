<h1>Factor Analysis using Q Methodology - A Computational Primer</h1>
<p>I encountered Factor Analysis for the first time early 2007 and
was quite curious to gain some understanding of the Q Method approach in
particular. I had a look through lots of texts and then slowly pieced it
together and this primer summarizes what I learnt.</p>

<h2>What is the analysis for?</h2>
<p>As an example, I'll take an issue like climate change and
interview say 20 people and ask them to what level they agree with a
whole range of climate change related statements, say 40 statements, all
with strongly disagree to strongly agree answers. I'll also ask them
questions about their preferences on issues like say Government Control,
Caring for the Environment, Financial Security, Happiness. With a bit of
luck and good management the participants will have been chosen to
represent the prevalence and spread of opinions of the population we
wish to study.</p>

<p>This is what I hope to learn from my factor analysis:
<p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>What standpoints are the underlying drivers of peoples opinion?</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>What information is being analyzed?</h2>
<p>Righto let's get into detail.</p>
<p><a id="M"><i>M</i></a> is the matrix of answers to the questions by
participant. Each row contains the answers of a participant.</p>
<p><i>P</i> is the matrix of answers to the preference questions by
participant. Each row contains the answers of a participant.</p>

<h2>Why the letter Q?</h2>
<p>Q Methodology is so called because a process called Q-sorting is
used on each participant's answers.</p>
<p>Q Methodology compares people. R Methodology compares test values
and is the more common statistical paradigm.</p>

<h2>How are people compared?</h2>
<p>To compare one participant against another we use a <a
	href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation">Pearsons
correlation</a>.</p>
<p class="maths">C = the Pearson correlation matrix of M.</p>
<p>In the matrix C for every participant we have a measure between
-1 and 1 (perfect negative correlation (-1) to no correlation (0) to
perfect correlation (1)) of how closely their answers match another
participant's.</p>

<h2>Data Reduction</h2>
<p>The first stage in this process is data reduction.</p>
<p>If n is the number of participants then C is an n x n matrix.
Let's try and <i>generate</i> the matrix M using a matrix L of n x m
entries (where m &lt;n).</p>

<p>The most obvious way I can think of to obtain an n x n matrix
from an n x m matrix is to multiply the n x m matrix by its transpose
(an m x n matrix). i.e. our data reduction problem could be expressed as</p>

<p class="maths"><i>Find an n x m matrix (m&lt;n) L where LL<sup>T</sup>
&#8776; M</i></p>

<p>As it turns out techniques like Principal Components Analysis
(PCA) or Thurstone's Centroid Method provide exactly such a matrix. The
matrix L is called the <i>loadings</i> matrix.</p>

<h2>Principal Components Analysis</h2>
<p><a
	href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_components_analysis">Principal
Components Analysis</a> is an eigenvalue decomposition technique.</p>

<p>The correlation matrix C is a symmetric matrix (C = C<sup>T</sup>)
and in this case PCA eigenvalue decomposition provides us with matrices
V and D where</p>

<p class="maths"><i>C = VDV<sup>T</sup></i></p>

<p>Moreover, the eigenvector matrix V is orthogonal and the matrix D
is diagonal with non-negative entries (why?).</p>

<p>The words <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalue"><i>eigenvalue</i></a>
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalue"><i>eigenvector</i></a>
are pretty irrelevant here. The only thing you need to know about them
is that the eigenvectors are orthogonal vectors and for each eigenvector
there is an eigenvalue.</p>

<p>Where is L?</p>
<p>&radic;D is the diagonal matrix with entries being the square
root of the corresponding entry of D.</p>
<p class="maths">L = V&radic;D</p>

<p>Using this definition of L,</p>
<p class="maths">LL<sup>T</sup> = V&radic;D(V&radic;D)<sup>T</sup> =
V&radic;D&radic;D<sup>T</sup>V<sup>T</sup> = V&radic;D&radic;D</sup>V<sup>T</sup>
= VDV<sup>T</sup> = C</p>

<h2>Centroid Method</h2>
<p>Here's the algorithm in pseudocode:</p>
<p>
<div class="code">
<div class="smallindent">C' = correlation matrix C<br>
for i=1 to the number of rows of C'<br>
<div class="smallindent">get the reflections of C' required to
obtain positive manifold<br>
H = apply the reflections to C'<br>
zero the diagonal of H<br>
for 10 iterations<br>
<div class="smallindent">K = (the vector of the sum of the rows of
H) * 1/&radic;(sum of entries in H)<br>
set the diagonal of H to be the square of the entries in K</div>
loop<br>
the ith eigenvalue = the sum of the square of the entries in K<br>
the ith eigenvector = K with each entry divided by the sqrt of the ith
eigenvalue<br>
residual = (reflections applied to C') - KK<sup>T</sup><br>
zero the diagonal of the residual<br>
residual = apply the reflections to the residual<br>
set C' to be the residual</div>
loop</div>
</div>
</p>

<p>To get the reflections required for positive manifold:</p>
<p>
<div class="code">
<div class="smallindent">
L' = L<br>
set the diagonal of L' to zero<br>
while the smallest column total in L' is negative<br>
<div class="smallindent">
	i = the column with the least total<br>
	multiply column i of L' by -1<br>
	multiply row i of L' by -1<br>
	multiply entry in the ith row, ith column of L' by -1<br>
	add i to the list of reflections<br>
</div>
loop<br>
</div>
</div>
</p>

<h2>Factors</h2>
<p>The <i>factors</i> are the columns of the loadings matrix L.</p>

<p>The <i>eigenvalue</i> of a factor is the sum of the squares of
the entries in the column of L corresponding to the factor.</p>

<h2>Factor Interpretation</h2>
<p>Having obtained some factors, we would like to know what the
factors represent. To help us interpret the factors we calculate <i>factor
scores.</i></p>

<h2>Factor Scores</h2>
<p>The algorithm for calculating factor scores from loadings matrix L is:</p>
<div class="code">
<div class="smallindent">
t = t-test score for n=number of rows in L, required confidence level (say 90%)<br>
threshold = t / &radic;n<br>
L' = L where entries with absolute value &lt; threshold set to zero<br>
zero those rows of L' which have more than one non-zero entry<br>
replace each entry x of L' with x/(1-x<sup>2</sup>)<br>
divide each entry of L' with the largest absolute value of the entries in the entry column<br> 
S = <a href="#M">M</a>L'<br> 
get the distribution of values in the first column of M<br>
apply that distribution to each column of S<br>
S is now the factor scores matrix<br>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Rotation</h2>
<p>Bear in mind that if you can find one L then you have an infinity
of possible Ls to choose from.</p>
<p>If R is a matrix that satisfies RR<sup>T</sup> = I (the identity
matrix) then LR is an alternative loadings matrix.</p>

<p>To check</p>
<p class="maths">LR (LR)<sup>T</sup> = LR(R<sup>T</sup>L<sup>T</sup>)
= L(RR<sup>T</sup>)L<sup>T</sup>) = LIL<sup>T</sup> = LL<sup>T</sup></p>
<p>As it happens a <a
	href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix">rotation matrix</a>
is just such a matrix. Another example is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_matrix#Row-switching_transformations">elementary row switching matrix</a>.</p>
